                <h2>Voltage or Current Source</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>A Source is a device which converts mechanical, chemical, thermal or some other form of energy into electrical energy. In other words, the source is an active network element meant for generating electrical energy. The various types of sources available in the electrical network are voltage source and current sources. A voltage source has a forcing function of emf whereas the current source has a forcing function of current.</p>

                <h2>Resistor</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. High-power resistors that can dissipate many watts of electrical power as heat may be used as part of motor controls, in power distribution systems, or as test loads for generators. Fixed resistors have resistances that only change slightly with temperature, time or operating voltage.</p>

                <h2>Wire</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The wires in an electrical circuit are made of a material called conductor that helps these transmit electricity. These wires have low resistance to electric current. Copper and aluminum are usually used as the wire material in fluorescent bulbs.</p>

                <h2>Capacitor</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It is a passive electronic component with two terminals. The effect of a capacitor is known as capacitance. While some capacitance exists between any two electrical conductors in proximity in a circuit, a capacitor is a component designed to add capacitance to a circuit. The capacitor was originally known as a condenser or condensator.[1] This name and its cognates are still widely used in many languages, but rarely in English, one notable exception being condenser microphones, also called capacitor microphones.</p>

                <h2>Inductor</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>An inductor, also called a coil, choke, or reactor, is a passive two-terminal electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it.[1] An inductor typically consists of an insulated wire wound into a coil. When the current flowing through the coil changes, the time-varying magnetic field induces an electromotive force (e.m.f.) (voltage) in the conductor, described by Faraday's law of induction. According to Lenz's law, the induced voltage has a polarity (direction) which opposes the change in current that created it. As a result, inductors oppose any changes in current through them.</p>
